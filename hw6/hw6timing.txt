1c. Does your ECHashStringSet look roughly linear or roughly quadratic
in its scaling behavior for random strings?
It seems to be linear as when we double N, the time increase roughly double.
(1.10 * 2 = 2.20 almost equals to 2.08)

2c. Does your **BST**StringSet look roughly linear or roughly
quadratic in its scaling behavior for in order strings?
I tried to run N = 30000:
	Inserting 30000 in-order strings into a StringSet of type BSTStringSet
	Took: 9.18 sec.
It seems to be quadratic, honestly.

Before submitting, make sure that your ECHashStringSet is capable of
handling inputs of size 1000000 in a reasonable amount of time (a few
seconds).

My ECHashStringSet is able to handle this, but BSTString can't.
